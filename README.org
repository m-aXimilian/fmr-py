#+title: Minimal FMR python-implementation
#+subtitle: with basic device support
#+author: Maximilian KÃ¼ffner

* Prerequisites
- Python3.# and pyvisa (~pip install pyvisa~)
_- NI-DAQmx Python API (~pip install nidaqmx~)_
- NI-DAQmx Pyhton API (~python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python.git~) [fn:1]
- NIVisa
- pyyaml (~pip install pyyaml~)

[fn:1] ~Sequence~ moved from ~collections~ to ~collections.abc~ in Python 3.10 which yiedls include errors when using pip [[https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/issues/129][nidaqmx issue 129]]

* Hints 
- make sure that ~pyvisa~ is aware of the NIVisa backend. If not, specify the path to the ~visa64.dll~ for the resource manager
- the path to the NIVisa backend can be set in a file called ~.pyvisarc~ (see [[https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/configuring.html][backend configuration]])
